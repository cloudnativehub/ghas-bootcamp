### _**Lab 1**_

#### Enabling Dependabot alerts
Dependabot can be enabled in the settings of an organization or a repository.

- Go to the repository settings and enable Dependabot alerts in the `Code security and analysis` section. You will be prompted to enable the dependency graph if it's not enabled already.

#### Reviewing the dependency graph
Dependabot uses the dependency graph to determine which dependencies are used by your project.

- Verify in the dependency graph that it found dependencies for:
    - The frontend service.
    - The authentication service.
    - The gallery service.
    - The storage service.

The dependency graph can be accessed from the `Insights` tab in your repository.

#### Viewing and managing results

After a few minutes, the `Security` tab in the repository will indicate that there are new security alerts. You will see a **Create a security update** button; click this button to create a pull request (PR) to update the vulnerable dependency. The next section will show you how to enable security updates for all applicable Dependabot alerts.

**Note**: If this not the case, we can trigger an analysis by updating `authn-service/requirements.txt`

1. Go to the Dependabot alert section to view the detected dependency issues.

For each dependency alert, we have the option to create a security update or to dismiss the alert with a reason.

2. For one of the alerts, create a dependency security update. If Dependabot can update the dependency automatically, it will create a PR.

3. For one of the alerts, dimiss the alert.

#### Enabling Dependabot security updates

Dependabot can automatically create PRs to upgrade vulnerable dependencies to non-vulnerable versions. Please note that there may be some Dependabot alerts that don't have patches. In those cases, a security update is not available.

- Go to the repository settings and enable Dependabot security updates in the *Code security & analysis* section.

After a few minutes multiple PRs will be created that will upgrade vulnerable dependencies.

#### Configuring Dependabot version updates

You can enable Dependabot [*version updates*](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates) by checking in a dependabot.yml into your repository's `.github` directory. Dependabot security updates uses this configuration as well. To successfully integrate the security updates into the SDLC, it is possible to configure various aspects such as:

- When version updates are created.
- What labels are assigned to enable filtering options.
- Who is assigned to the PR and who should review it.
- Which dependencies are updated and how they are updated.

Create the `.github/dependabot.yml` file in your repository and configure the `pip` dependency manager to:
  1. Look for dependency information in the `authn-service` directory.

  2. Schedule daily version updates.

  3. Prefix the commit message with the `pip` package manager.

  4. Assign the PR to yourself and a person from your workshop team as a reviewer. When specifying GitHub handles in the yml, do so without the `@` symbol. Please see the following solution as an example.

  5. Add the custom label `triage-required` to enable filtering of the PRs.

  6. Verify your changes by adding a [vulnerable dependency](https://github.com/advisories?query=severity%3Ahigh+ecosystem%3Apip) to `auth-service/requirements.txt`. For example:

    ```requirements.txt
    ...
    django==2.1.0
    ```

How would you know if the configuration cannot be satisfied?

1. Add a non-existing label to the configuration.

2. Trigger a new dependabot security update by adding a vulnerable dependency to one of the projects.
   For example, we can add the dependency `django-two-factor-auth==1.11` to `auth-service/requirements.txt`

3. Look at the created PR to determine if the configuration has been satisfied.

4. Use Dependabot chat commands to [manage PRs from Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/managing-pull-requests-for-dependency-updates).

#### Working with Dependency Review

If a PR has dependency changes, you can [review](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-dependency-changes-in-a-pull-request) them and see if there are known vulnerabilities with the dependency changes.

   1. Add a vulnerable dependency to `auth-service/requirements.txt` and commit to a new branch. For example, here's a vulnerable dependency:

    ```requirements.txt
    ...
    django-piston==0.2.0
    ```
   2. Create a PR, and click on `Files changed`.
   3. Click on the `Display the rich diff` button on the `requirements.txt` file to review dependency changes.
